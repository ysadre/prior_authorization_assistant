# Prior Authorization Assistant

This project is an AI-powered assistant that extracts prior authorization guidelines from payer PDFs and provides responses using ChatGPT.

The backend is built with FastAPI and handles PDF text extraction, vector search, and AI-driven query processing. The frontend is a simple React app that allows users to ask questions about prior authorization requirements.

To set up, install the required dependencies, run the FastAPI server, and start the React frontend.
